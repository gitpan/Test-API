NAME
    Test::API - Test a list of subroutines provided by a module

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More tests => 3;
        use Test::API;

        require_ok( 'My::Package' );
    
        public_ok ( 'My::Package', @names );
    
        import_ok ( 'My::Package',
            export    => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],
            export_ok => [ 'baz', 'bam' ], 
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This simple test module checks the subroutines provided by a module.
    This is useful for confirming a planned API in testing and ensuring that
    other functions aren't unintentionally included via import.

USAGE
    Note: Subroutines in a package starting with an underscore are ignored.
    Therefore, do not include them in any list of expected subroutines.

  public_ok
      public_ok( $package, @names );

    This function checks that all of the @names provided are available
    within the $package namespace and that *only* these subroutines are
    available. This means that subroutines imported from other modules will
    cause this test to fail unless they are explicitly included in @names.

  import_ok
      import_ok ( $package, %spec );

    This function checks that $package correctly exports an expected list of
    subroutines and *only* these subroutines. The %spec generally follows
    the style used by [Exporter], but in lower case:

      %spec = (
        export    => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],  # exported automatically
        export_ok => [ 'baz', 'bam' ],  # optional exports
      );

    For "export_ok", the test will check for public functions not listed in
    "export" or "export_ok" that can be imported and will fail if any are
    found.
