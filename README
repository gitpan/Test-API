NAME
    Test::API - Test a list of subroutines provided by a module

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.001.

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::More tests => 2;
         use Test::API;
     
     require_ok( 'My::Package' );
         public_ok ( 'My::Package', @names );

DESCRIPTION
    This simple test module checks the subroutines provided by a module.
    This is useful for confirming a planned API in testing and ensuring that
    other functions aren't unintentionally included via import.

USAGE
  public_ok
       public_ok( $package, @names );

    This function checks that all of the @names provided are available
    within the $package namespace and that only these subroutines are
    available. This means that subroutines imported from other modules will
    cause this test to fail unless they are explicitly included in @names.

    Subroutines in $package starting with an underscore are excluded from
    consideration. Therefore, do not include subroutines with an underscore
    in @names.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests using the CPAN Request
    Tracker web interface at

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
