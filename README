NAME
    Test::API - Test a list of subroutines provided by a module

VERSION
    version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More tests => 3;
        use Test::API;

        require_ok( 'My::Package' );

        public_ok ( 'My::Package', @names );

        import_ok ( 'My::Package',
            export    => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],
            export_ok => [ 'baz', 'bam' ],
        );

        class_api_ok( 'My::Class', @methods );

DESCRIPTION
    This simple test module checks the subroutines provided by a module.
    This is useful for confirming a planned API in testing and ensuring that
    other functions aren't unintentionally included via import.

USAGE
    Note: Subroutines starting with an underscore are ignored, as are a
    number of other methods not intended to be called directly by end-users.

      AUTOLOAD BUILD BUILDARGS CLONE CLONE_SKIP DESTROY DEMOLISH

      FETCH_REF_ATTRIBUTES FETCH_SCALAR_ATTRIBUTES FETCH_ARRAY_ATTRIBUTES
      FETCH_HASH_ATTRIBUTES FETCH_CODE_ATTRIBUTES FETCH_GLOB_ATTRIBUTES
      FETCH_FORMAT_ATTRIBUTES FETCH_IO_ATTRIBUTES

    Therefore, do not include any of these in a list of expected
    subroutines.

  public_ok
      public_ok( $package, @names );

    This function checks that all of the @names provided are available
    within the $package namespace and that *only* these subroutines are
    available. This means that subroutines imported from other modules will
    cause this test to fail unless they are explicitly included in @names.

  class_api_ok
      class_api_ok( $class, @names );

    A variation of "public_ok" for object-oriented modules. Allows
    superclasses to fill in "missing" subroutines, but "extra" methods
    provided by superclasses will not cause the test to fail.

  import_ok
      import_ok ( $package, %spec );

    This function checks that $package correctly exports an expected list of
    subroutines and *only* these subroutines. The %spec generally follows
    the style used by [Exporter], but in lower case:

      %spec = (
        export    => [ 'foo', 'bar' ],  # exported automatically
        export_ok => [ 'baz', 'bam' ],  # optional exports
      );

    For "export_ok", the test will check for public functions not listed in
    "export" or "export_ok" that can be imported and will fail if any are
    found.
